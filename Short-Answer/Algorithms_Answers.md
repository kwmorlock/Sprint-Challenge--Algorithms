#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) When input increases the runtime will increase at the same rate, not a bad solution compared to some other Big O run times. 


b) O(n^2) Not a good run time, because of nested loops that all rely on n. 


c) O(n) This is a recursive function that runs linear.
